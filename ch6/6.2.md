## Arrow Operator

We use struct pointer quite often, thus C provides a convinent way (`->` operator) to access the member variable of a struct object by pointer:

```c
pp -> x // equal to (*pp).x
```

## Operator Priority

Among all operators, the following four have highest priority: `struct` operators `.` and `->`, function calling `()` and indexing `[]`.

Some examples are shown below:

```c
struct {
  	int len;
  	char *str;
} *p;

++p -> len;    // increment `len`
(++p) -> len;  // increment `p` and access `len` by `p`
*p -> str;     // access `str` and dereference it
*p -> str++;   // access `str`, dereference it, and increment `str`
(*p -> str)++; // access `str`, dereference it, and increment `p`
```
