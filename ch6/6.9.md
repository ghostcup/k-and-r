## bit-field

```c
struct {
    unsigned int is_keyword;
    unsigned int is_extern;
    unsigned int is_static;
}
```

This structure requires 12 (3 * `int`) bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. 

To declare a bit-field:

```c
struct {
    unsigned int is_keyword : 1;
    unsigned int is_extern  : 1;
    unsigned int is_static  : 1;
} flags;
```

> The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 3 bits will be used to store the values. If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit,  then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you  have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it  will start using 8 bytes. [1]
