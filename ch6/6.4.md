## Pointer to struct

We define a binary search algorithm used for finding the element in `tab[0] ... tab[n-1]` which is matched with the input word.

```c
struct key *binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n) {
    int cond;
    struct key *low = &tab[0];
    struct key *high = &tab[n]; // [1]
    struct key *mid;
    
    while (low < high) {
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // [2]
        if ((cond = strcmp(word, mid->word)) < 0)
            high = mid;
        else if (cond > 0)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            return mid;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

Two points to notice:

1.  C allows it though accessing `tab[n]` is undefined behaviour.
2.  The addition operation of two pointers is invalid, but subtraction is valid. So, we can calculate the difference between low and high, then add it to low to get mid.

### struct Array Traversal

```c
for (p = keytab; p < keytab + NKEYS; p++) {
    // ...
}
```
